# Element Tester - Package-level Environment Variables
# ============================================================================
#
# This .env file is for running scripts directly from within the
# src/element_tester/ directory tree (less common).
#
# PYTHONPATH:
# - ${workspaceFolder} is a VS Code variable that resolves to workspace root
# - Ensures src/ is in path even when running from deeply nested directories
#
# WHY TWO .ENV FILES:
# - Root .env (../../.env): For running from workspace root (primary)
# - This .env: Fallback for running from within src/element_tester/ subdirs
# - VS Code looks for .env files upward from the script being run
#
# HOW TO MODIFY:
# - Generally, prefer the root .env over this one
# - If you restructure to multi-package workspace:
#     PYTHONPATH=${workspaceFolder}/src:${workspaceFolder}/other_src
# - Can be deleted if all scripts are run from workspace root
#
# RECOMMENDATION:
# - Use root .env for consistency
# - This file can be removed if not needed
