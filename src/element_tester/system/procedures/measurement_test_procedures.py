"""
Measurement Test Procedures

High-level procedures for executing resistance measurement tests.
Contains reusable test sequences and relay configurations for measuring
resistance between specific pins on the DUT.

Usage:
    import element_tester.system.procedures.measurement_test_procedures as meas_procs
    
    meas_procs.close_pin1to6(relay_driver)
    resistance = meter.read_resistance()
    meas_procs.open_all_relays(relay_driver)

Relay Mapping (adjust based on your actual hardware):
- Relay 0: Left side pin 1
- Relay 1: Left side pin 2
- Relay 2: Left side pin 3
- Relay 3: Meter position
- Relay 4: Right side pin 1
- Relay 5: Right side pin 2
- Relay 6: Right side pin 3
- Relay 7: Hipot circuit (not used for measurements)
